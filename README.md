# freecodecampmemo

This is my memo for the courses taken on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/). 
The text and examples are not written by me (mostly) and were taken from the FreeCodeCamp exercises for the purpose of having a single reference point. 

1. [Basic HTML and CSS](files/basic_html_and_css.md)
2. [Basic visual design](files/visual_design.md): text 
3. [Basic HTML and CSS](files/visual_design_2.md): positioning, pseudo-classes and animation
